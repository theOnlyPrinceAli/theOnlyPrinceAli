- 👋 Hi, I’m @theOnlyPrinceAli
- 👀 I’m interested in ... finding a company that is willing to take a chance on an entry level programmer that needs some hand-holding in the beginning... but learns quickly. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... anything I can find. I will probably brush up on my java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any small project or role so that I may get as much experience as plausible. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email or SMS.
